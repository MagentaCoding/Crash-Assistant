- Now the modpack logo is displayed at the center, not on top. Added an option to return it to the top.
    - If the modpack logo was square, anyway it consumed all available height, and this didn't matter.
      This is applicable only for non-square logos.
- Now config is restoring its canonical order for newly added keys.
- Added a "Too Many Changes" warning for modpacks, disabled by default.
  Allows configuring how many changes modpack creator allows
  and displaying warning if the end user modified modpack, too heavily.

        - Added `general.generate_localization_overrides_folder_with_readme` - Option to disable creating the
          localization overrides folder and README.md
    - **Language File Processing Improvements:**
        - Override files now only contain translations that differ from JAR defaults
        - Automatic cleanup of redundant entries:
            - Removes keys that don't exist in en_us (base language)
            - Removes entries marked with `$DEFAULT` (generated by the old version of mod)
            - Removes entries that match JAR values exactly
        - Empty override files are automatically deleted
        - Override files are rewritten to remove redundant entries
    - **Language Loading Logic:**
        - Simplified language loading process:
            1. Load from current language overrides
            2. Load from priority language overrides (if configured)
            3. Load from JAR language files
        - No longer generates override files with `$DEFAULT` placeholders
        - Cleaner override files containing only actual customizations

  Also fixes Crash Assistant not starting issue if crash happened in some MixinConfigPlugin(before PreLaunchEntrypoint).
- Forge coremod: Returned launch of our process to a constructor (to the first possible point) instead of
  `initialize()`. This was done earlier because some needed params were unavailable that early. But I've found a way to
  parse them. So now I reverted that old change.
- Added Auto-Fix option for the Integrated GPU warning. Now can fix the issue with just one click instead of following a
  quite complex guide for inexperienced users.

    - `LegacyTooManyIds` - Too many ids on 1.12.2 and below.
    - `NeoForgeVersion1_20_1` - Notifies that Neo on 1.20.1 is abandoned and causing many crashes and switching to Forge
      is an official recommendation from Neo on that version.
    - `ConnectorIncompatibleFabricMods` - Detects if tried to run fabric mod with connector, but's it's incompatible and
      won't work. Suggests native forge alternatives if they exist. Currently, Sodium, Iris, Lithium.
- Added new launcherlogs support: ElyPrism, SKLauncher, LegacyLauncher, CrystalLauncher,
  KLauncher, PollyMC, Feather, Lunar, Technic.

- Fixed `CreateDependencies` was working incorrectly for fabric.
- New GUI analysis tools:
    - `MCreator Mod Detector` - Detects MCreator mods. Was already in `modlist.txt`, but now as separate GUI tool.
    - `Epic Fight mod addons compatibility` - Same as `Create mod addons compatibility` but for Epic Fight mods.
    - `Package/Class Finder` - Helps to find from which mod a class or package came.
    - `Jdeps Dependencies Analysis` - Helps to find which mod depends on a class. This is especially helpful if you see
      NoClassDefFoundError or ClassNotFoundException in your logs and don’t know which mod requires that missing class.
- Redesigned Analysis menu, now displays a short description.
- Now suggesting to use `Epic Fight mod addons compatibility` in `EpicFightAddons` log analysis.
- 1.12.2 and earlier: Improved `OutOfMemory` analysis recommendations. Now recommending available mods on that version.
- 1.12.2: Added compat with `Improved Cleanroom Relauncher` and `Cleanroom relauncher unofficial`. Fixed starting twice.
- Prevented a Crash Assistant mod file being locked while the crash assistant is running.
- Prevented McLogs from censoring IP-like versions.
- Localization: Added missing, fixed outdated and sorted keys across en, ru, it, es, zh;
- Added German localization. Thanks `MagentaCoding` for making PR.
- Jvm.dll analysis: Added one more possible reason for this.
- Fixed issue with non-ASCII paths causing Crash Assistant not to start. E.g., Cyrillic or Chinese symbols in the path.
- Removed CrashAssistantAgent and refactored classpath handling to improve stability on non-ASCII paths.
- `TerminatedProcessesFinder`: Fixed handling of non-standard datetime formats, which caused PS cmd to ignore
  time filter and grab all available event errors instead of just those from the last 15 seconds.
- Fixed hs_err log can be not added in some rare cases.
- Fixed Jdeps analysis didn't checked version of java, caused analysis detected nothing in case usage of outdated jdk.
- Fixed mod on Quilt mod-loader wasn't working since some version due to bad QuiltZipPath implementation in the loader.
- Fixed mod not working on Lunar Client because Lunar was ignoring PreLaunchEntrypoint.
- Fixed mod was identifying platform as fabric if was used fabric version of mod on forge with help of Connector.
- Fixed `ResourceLocationException` analysis wasn't triggered in some rare cases.
- Fixed ANSI color formatting was still applied in modlist diff, ignoring `generated_message.color_message` setting.
- Small fixes, formatting cleanups, and internal improvements.
- The mod was relicensed under `KostromDan’s Modded Minecraft License (Version 1.1.3)`. Unfortunately, the LGPL did not
  protect my rights and interests as I expected (it should have covered this case, but CurseForge decided that
  derivative code does not need to comply with LGPL terms and conditions and, moreover, does not need to give any
  attribution to the original project, even allowing others to falsely claim it as their own code). It may be due to
  some confusion and complexity of the situation, but it is what it is. I am now initiating a court case, which will
  cost me a lot of money, and that fact is quite disappointing. I am also disappointed that I had to relicense, but I
  don’t see another way. There is a lot of drama. If this drama ever ends, I will most likely revert the license back to
  LGPL.
